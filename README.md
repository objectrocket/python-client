ObjectRocket Python Client
==========================
ObjectRocket API interface library for Python.

**NOTICE:** this client is still undergoing intial stages of development, and some public interfaces may change as development continues. We will increment the version of this package to 1.0.0 once the public interface to this library is deemed stable.


### examples
To use the library, simply do the following:


```python
>>> import objectrocket

>>> client = objectrocket.Client()
>>> client.authenticate('<username>', '<password>')

# Create a new instance.
>>> client.instances.create(name='instance0', size=5, zone='US-West'
<MongodbInstance {...} at 0x10aedb990>

# Get an instances object.
>>> client.instances.get('instance0')
<MongodbInstance {...} at 0x10aedb980>

# Get all instances.
>>> client.instances.all()
[<MongodbInstance {...} at 0x10aedb980>]
```


### installation

    pip install objectrocket


### development
#### test
Testing against local you will want to export a couple environment variables:

```sh
export OR_DEFAULT_API_URL='http://localhost:5050/v2/'
export OR_DEFAULT_ADMIN_API_URL='http://localhost:5050/admin/'
```

Before you push your code, run `tox` from the top level directory. If errors
are reported, fix them.

#### coverage
To receive a test coverage report, run `tox -e coverage` from the top level directory.

#### build
To build the client, invoke `tox -e build` from the top level directory.
Your artifact will appear in the `dist` directory, and will look
something like `objectrocket-<version>-py2.py3-<abi>-<platform>.whl`.

###### pypi
To upload the built artifact to **pypytest** or **pypi**, you will need the account credentials. To upload to **pypytest**, invoke the following:

```bash
tox -e build -- upload -r pypitest
```

To upload to **pypi**, invoke the following:

```bash
tox -e build -- upload -r pypi
```

#### documentation
To build the documentation, invoke `tox -e docs` from the top level directory.
The HTML index can then be found at `docs/build/html/index.html`.
